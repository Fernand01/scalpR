scalpV: A Fraud Prevention Mobile Application to secure validity for an event  

White Paper

Abstract: Fight Test: A simple, automatic scanning of admissions papers to any event within seconds.  Providing a validation that the admissions papers being purchased are in fact valid and have not be already used to enter a venue.  API access provides part of the solution, seamless customer experience providing confirmation and security of their purchase.  This will eventually scale for a marketable of (XXXXXXXXXX) providing secure validations, social media connection and digital exchanges, wiping out the duplication issue for good with token caching technology using a server-less cloud architecture. It is also Yoshimi battling the pink robots, simply put…

1. Introduction-Version 1 Yoshimi: Currently Ticketmaster owns XXX% and majority stake in the event/entertainment arena.  Customers are frustrated with extra fees, bots/scalpers snagging tickets before a “true fan” can manage to secure the nose bleed section of Madison Square Garden for $700.00.  There are multiple flaws in this technology architecture and scalpV can provide a better customer experience when ticket buyers have to finally face that bot in the street to by the ticket for  a 150% mark up.  scalpV can not stop the efforts of scalpers, that is not its objective at the core.  scalpV will however, allow the last minute ticket buyer or any buyer who could not buy from the event’s “true” source can in fact determine 1. if the ticket is legit 2. if it has entered the venue.  This reassurance before you buy the ticket should at least have an effect on the counterfeit ticket providers, hopefully eliminating them completely.

2. Version 2 : The Battle; Currently with scalpV1 in place in the market, there is still one more solution to provide and one that could drastically decline the number of duplicate tickets for their events. Solving the problem of duplication.  Currently you can print a ticket and recopy it to resemble a an electronically printed ticket, but there are even counterfeiters that will sell real rectangular tickets with the perforated middle to tear for admission (the original duplication preventer) and sell these to people just outside the venue but just out of reach to verify with the door guy.  A bad experience for the customer that TM has not solved.   By employing token verification and encryption we could pass these passwords and coins so that every time after original delivery, every time it is duplicated the coin passes on only to the new copy.  Even if someone was so good to photoshop a ticket, the coin would not be present and scalpV could scan and would also recognize this token technology allowing for data of how many times people are duplicating tickets from a single ticket, the token would also be able to provide the original source for every transfer including the original one from TM to the attendee, showing you accounts that are in fact using their account with TM to solely buy tickets for scalping.  Through blockchain technology.There may be possibilities to look into the metadata providing information from the origin and providing future interest.
