Paper verification story board

Ticket Buyer approaches Ticket Seller though any medium: Craigslist, Random ticket websites, etc
Ticket Buyer(TB) contacts Ticket Seller(TS) and agree to meet
Upon meeting Ticket Buyer can inspect the ticket 
Next they can open the scalpR app and the first screen after loading screen is permission to access camera
Once accepeted TB can hold paper ticket infront of their phone on their camera and the camera barcode reader will automatically process the barcode
The results coming back are to validate if this ticket will process as valid when a door scanner at the venue scans it
TB gets a Green "Legit" confirmation OR a Red "Not Legit" confirmation 
TB can choose how to proceed with the TS at this point
The app has served its purpose
